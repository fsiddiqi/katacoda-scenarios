This assumes that your API is available on Developer Central.  

We'll start with a very simple client application using your favorite UI framework. Angular, React, ASP.NET or Express will work - anything that can call REST APIs via HTTP and bind the results to HTML.

#### Clone Quickstart Template
Start with Node and Express - this will limit the amount of code needed 

Clone the Quickstart Template:
`git clone https://github.com/fsiddiqi/api-client; cd api-client`{{execute}}
