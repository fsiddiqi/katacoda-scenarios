#### Background
This assumes that your API is available on Developer Central.  

We'll start with a very simple client application using your favorite UI framework. Angular, React, ASP.NET or Express will work - anything that can call REST APIs via HTTP and bind the results to HTML.

#### What will learners need?
* A web browser - the whole session will be entirely browser based
* Familiarity with javascript 
* About 20 minutes
* If something doesn't work, try going back to a previous step
